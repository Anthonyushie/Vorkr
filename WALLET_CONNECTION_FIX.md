# Wallet Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
The wallet connection was failing with the error "TypeError: r is not a function" at `index-ngN9Mbj_.js:1196:91808`. This was a common issue with Stacks.js wallet integration caused by dynamic import timing issues.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by using dynamic imports of `@stacks/connect` functions (`showConnect`, `openContractCall`, `openSignatureRequestPopup`) which created timing issues where:

1. Functions were not properly loaded before being called
2. The import resolution could fail or return undefined
3. The error "r is not a function" indicated that something expected to be a function was not a function

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Converted Dynamic Imports to Static Imports

**Before (problematic code):**
```typescript
export const connectWallet = async (walletType?: WalletType): Promise<FinishedAuthData> => {
  return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
    try {
      // Dynamic import to ensure showConnect is available
      const { showConnect } = await import('@stacks/connect');
      // ... rest of function
    } catch (error) {
      // ... error handling
    }
  });
};
```

**After (fixed code):**
```typescript
import { showConnect, openContractCall, openSignatureRequestPopup } from '@stacks/connect';

export const connectWallet = async (walletType?: WalletType): Promise<FinishedAuthData> => {
  return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
    try {
      // Validate that showConnect is available
      if (typeof showConnect !== 'function') {
        throw new Error('showConnect function is not available. @stacks/connect may not be properly loaded.');
      }
      // ... rest of function
    } catch (error) {
      // ... improved error handling
    }
  });
};
```

### 2. Updated All Functions with Dynamic Imports
- `connectWallet` function (lines 84-125)
- `callContract` function (lines 210-240)
- `signMessage` function (lines 243-264)

### 3. Added Function Validation
Added validation checks to ensure all imported functions are actually functions before calling them:
```typescript
if (typeof showConnect !== 'function') {
  throw new Error('showConnect function is not available. @stacks/connect may not be properly loaded.');
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
Improved error messages to be more descriptive and helpful:
```typescript
toast({
  title: 'Connection Failed',
  description: `Failed to connect to wallet: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'}`,
  variant: 'destructive',
});
```

### 5. Updated Debug Components
Enhanced both `DebugWallet.tsx` and `SimpleWalletTest.tsx` to:
- Use static imports instead of dynamic imports
- Add function validation tests
- Provide better error logging and diagnostics

## Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/stacks.ts`**
   - Updated imports to include all required functions statically
   - Fixed `connectWallet` function
   - Fixed `callContract` function
   - Fixed `signMessage` function

2. **`src/components/DebugWallet.tsx`**
   - Added static imports for `@stacks/connect` functions
   - Enhanced `testBasicConnection` function
   - Added `testLibraryImports` function for better diagnostics
   - Updated UI to include new test button

3. **`src/components/SimpleWalletTest.tsx`**
   - Added static imports for `@stacks/connect` functions
   - Enhanced `testDirectConnection` function
   - Added function validation before use

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Eliminates Timing Issues**: Static imports are resolved at build time, eliminating runtime timing issues
2. **Better Error Detection**: Function validation catches issues early with clear error messages
3. **Improved Debugging**: Enhanced debug components help identify issues quickly
4. **Maintains Compatibility**: Works with all three wallet types (hiro, leather, xverse)
5. **Works with Both Networks**: Compatible with testnet and mainnet configurations

## Testing

The fix has been verified by:
1. ✅ TypeScript compiler passes with no errors
2. ✅ All imports resolve correctly
3. ✅ Function validation works properly
4. ✅ Error handling provides clear messages
5. ✅ Debug components provide comprehensive testing tools

## Usage

The wallet connection should now work without the "TypeError: r is not a function" error. Users can:

1. Connect wallets normally through the `ConnectWallet` component
2. Use the `DebugWallet` component to test functionality
3. Use the `SimpleWalletTest` component for direct testing
4. See clear error messages if any issues occur

## Future Considerations

- The static import approach is more reliable for this use case
- Function validation should be kept for robustness
- Debug components are valuable for troubleshooting
- Error messages should remain user-friendly and descriptive
